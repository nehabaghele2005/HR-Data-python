👨‍💼 HR Data Analysis – Python Project
This project involves the analysis of structured HR employee data using Python. The dataset includes marital status, gender, employment status, and department details for each employee. The primary goal is to perform data cleaning, statistical analysis, and generate HR insights to support decision-making.

📊 Dataset Overview
Column Name	Description
Employee_Name	Full name of the employee
EmpID	Unique employee identifier
MarriedID	Binary (1 = Married, 0 = Not Married)
MaritalStatusID	Categorical ID indicating marital status (0 = Single, 1 = Married, etc.)
GenderID	0 = Female, 1 = Male
EmpStatusID	Employment status code (e.g., 1 = Active, 5 = Terminated, etc.)
DeptID	Department ID (used to group employees)

✅ Objectives
🔍 Analyze marriage and gender distribution among employees

📌 Filter employees by status (e.g., active, terminated)

📊 Count employees by department and marital status

⚙️ Prepare data for visualization or dashboard reporting

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python 3.x

pandas – Data manipulation and transformation

matplotlib / seaborn – For visualizing distributions

numpy – Statistical analysis

jupyter notebook – Exploratory data analysis

🧪 Sample Analysis Ideas
📌 Marital Status vs Gender: Compare distributions across categories

👨‍💻 Active vs Terminated Employees by department

💼 Department Size: Total number of employees in each department

🔢 Data Cleaning: Handle inconsistent values in categorical fields
